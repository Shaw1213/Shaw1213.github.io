# Welcome to My Dev Blog!

Hello and welcome to my new dev blog! I'm excited to finally have a space where I can share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings from my journey in game development.

## What to Expect

Here, I'll be writing about:

- **Game Development**: Insights from working on shipped games like Bricks Over Blocks, Beamdown, and Hampter Ball
- **Technical Design**: Deep dives into gameplay systems, UI architecture, and problem-solving approaches
- **Personal Projects**: Updates on my current work in progress, including my UE5 C++ action game
- **Learning**: Things I've learned along the way that might help other developers

## My Background

As a Technical Designer and Gamer, I've always been passionate about understanding not just *what* makes games fun, but *how* they're built. This curiosity has led me through various engines and technologies, from Unity to Unreal Engine 5, and from C# to C++ to Verse.

## Stay Connected

Feel free to check out my [portfolio](/) to see my work, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuxiao-zhang-dev). I'm always happy to chat about game development!

Thanks for stopping by, and stay tuned for more posts!
