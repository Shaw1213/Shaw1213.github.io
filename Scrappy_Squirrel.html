		This is my very Game Project that I have ever made. It is a 2D platformer game that I made in Unity. The game is about a squirrel that is trying to escape from a forest that is on fire. The squirrel has to jump over obstacles and avoid fireballs to survive. The game has 3 levels and the difficulty increases as the player progresses through the levels. The game is available on Itch.io and can be played in a web browser.
