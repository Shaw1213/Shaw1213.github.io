        <p>Game Engineer</p>
        <p>About Me</p>
        <p>Hi there! Welcome to my site!
            <br>I'm a passionate game enthusiast eager to break into the industry and make a lasting impact. 
            <br>My journey into gaming has a unique story—when I was younger, I had a special eye condition, and the doctor advised my parents to let me exercise my eyes more. That’s how I got my first Game Boy and PC, and I've been hooked ever since!
            <br>Currently, I'm playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/">Deadlock</a> by Valve, which I believe is the ultimate evolution of hero shooter games.
