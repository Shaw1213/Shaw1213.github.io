        This is project was a part of my Level Design class. I learned how to create a side scroller game and how to design levels for it.
        This project give me more insites on how to create game mechanics, such as the use of collection boxes, Tags and Trasnforms in Unity 2D.
        I also learned how to create a player controller and how to create a camera that follows the player smothely.
