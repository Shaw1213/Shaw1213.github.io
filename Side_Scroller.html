        This is project was a part of my Level Design class. I learned how to create a side scroller game and how to design levels for it.
        This project give me more insites on how to create game mechanics, such as the use of collection boxes, Tags and Trasnforms in Unity 2D.
        I also learned how to create a player controller and how to create a camera that follows the player smothely.

        This is the 3D level design Project I did for Level Design Class.
        It splitted in to three parts. FIrst part is a simple puzzle, Second part is clicking 
        a button while given ranmdom speed and junp height. Third part is Teleporting ablity. The Final part 
        is doge the obsticles and reach the end. This project really give me an
        optunity to implment different game mechanics and learn how to work under Unity 3D.
